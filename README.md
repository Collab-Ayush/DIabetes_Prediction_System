# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning  
A complete end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting diabetes using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.  
This notebook covers data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a supervised learning model to predict whether a patient is diabetic based on clinical attributes such as:
- Pregnancies  
- Glucose  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age  

The goal is to analyze the dataset, clean and preprocess the data, try multiple models, and evaluate their performance.
